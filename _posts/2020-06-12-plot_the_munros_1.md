## Introduction 

For this post I wanted to try working with some Geographic data in Python, as well as look for an opportunity to 

Spending the majority of spring and summer 2020 under a coronavirus-imposed lockdown gave me plenty of time to plan and scheme adventures for when restrictions were finally lifted.
Fortunately for me I have some great outdoor activities a few hours drive from where I live, with one of my favourites being hillwalking.
The Scottish hills are famous the world over for their splendid views, ruggedness and isolation.  Climbing them can be addictive.
Luckily there is something for everyone, easy ones, short ones, shallow ones, steep ones.  Some the size of your head.

Of all the hills you can climb in Scotland the Munros have the greatest allure.  These are the hills whose summit rests at least 3,000 ft over sea level.

The official number of munros has changed a little over the years, with summits being promoted or relegated by the [???] - usually due to their proximities to other summits marking them as 'tops' rather than munros in their own right.
There are currently 282 ??? Munros spread across Scotland, and some will dedicate a lifetime trying to ascend each one (usually on a fair weather weekend!).
There are others who would prefer to do it over a shorter period, the current record is ???, and the human-powered record is only ???. !!!

As the Munros are spread across the land, they can be grouped into distinct regions, each with their own characteristics: from the bleak and featureless Cairngorm plateau to the craggy summits of Westeross ??? - distinctions that arise from the vagries of ice age geological processes.

Nowadays the locations of each of the summits are well known, with many online resources available to help you plan a route and record how many you still have left to climb.

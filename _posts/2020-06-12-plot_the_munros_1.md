## Introduction 

Spending the majority of spring and summer 2020 under a coronavirus-imposed lockdown gave me plenty of time to plan and scheme adventures for when restrictions were finally lifted.
Fortunately for me I have some great outdoor activities a few hours drive from where I live, with one of my favourites being hillwalking.
The Scottish hills are famous the world over for their splendid views, ruggedness and isolation.  Climbing them can be addictive.
Luckily there is something for everyone, easy ones, short ones, shallow ones, steep ones.  Some the size of your head.

Of all the hills you can climb in Scotland the Munros have the greatest allure.  These are the hills whose summit rests at 3,000 ft over sea level.

## Part 3 - Building a Simple Model

With our dataset now explored it is time to do some data science.  Let's build a simple model on the male finishing times subset we looked at in Part 2.
One of the hardest parts of any data project is deciding what algorithm to use when modelling the data. 
To keep things simple I am going to use a straightforward clustering algorithm - K nearest neighbours.
In follow up posts I will examine the same dataset using some other classification algorithms to show how their accuracy varies.

KNN is a popular classification algorithm becuase it is simple to implement and relatively fast.  It works by *to do*.

We will be using the SciKit-Learn library to perform the classification, and displaying the results using matplotlib.

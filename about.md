Hello and welcome to my GitHub Pages site.
Here I plan to document some of the projects I've been working on and hopefully inspire some people to get out there and try make something themselves!
At the moment I'm interested in data science, chemoinformatics and game design with Unity.  

As I find that I learn best by explaining things to people there will probably be some simple tutorials about subjects I've struggled with.  

All content and opinions are my own shoddy work :)
